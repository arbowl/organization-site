                <p>
                    Commenting is open to all users, but posting privileges require the "contributor" role, which must be manually requested. This helps maintain quality by prioritizing clarity and structure over volume. Periodic open calls for contributor access will be announced in bulletin threads.

                <p>
                    Controversial takes are welcomed; misinformation is not. Information which can be
                    definitively proven wrong and which is not constructive will be removed. A controversial take
                    might look like <i>"Green energy isn't as 'clean' as it's marketed--the mining, manufacturing,
                    and disposal of solar panels and batteries have serious environmental and ethical costs we often ignore",</i>
                    as this is grounded in reality, and expresses a subjective opinion. 
                    Misinformation might look like <i>"Electric vehicles pollute more than gas cars over their entire lifespan"</i>,
                    because this is quantifiable (and <a href="https://theicct.org/publication/a-global-comparison-of-the-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-combustion-engine-and-electric-passenger-cars/">false</a>).

                <p>
                    Publicly available information is fair game; revealing private information is forbidden.
                    Any attempt to jeapordize a user's privacy or security will be swiftly removed and penalized.
